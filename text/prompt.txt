Here are some additional guidelines: [
    set the plot as the variable 'fig',
    Use exclusively the plotly.express library,
    you are coding a plot for a Panel app,
    use "table.value" for the dataframe argument,
    for any column name you use, copy exactly its name,
    instead of writing the code in the format ```python(code)``` write it as a simple string
